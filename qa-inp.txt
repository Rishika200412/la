# QA Process Documentation
 
## Testing Methodology
We follow an Agile testing process integrated within 2-week sprints.  
Testing activities include unit testing, integration testing, regression testing, and exploratory testing.
 
## Test Coverage
Our automated test coverage is 65%. Manual test coverage for key features is 90%.  
Critical path scenarios are covered in every release cycle.
 
## Pass/Fail Criteria
- All critical and high-severity defects must be resolved before release.  
- Medium defects can be deferred if risk-assessed and approved by the QA Lead.  
- No P1 or P2 open bugs allowed at release time.
 
## Team Preparedness
QA team consists of 4 automation engineers and 2 manual testers.  
Automation framework: Playwright + TypeScript.  
CI/CD integrated with GitHub Actions.
 
## Risk and Mitigation
Main risks include flaky tests and insufficient load testing.  
Plans to improve load testing in next quarter.
